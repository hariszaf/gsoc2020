Here you can find how the [tests](https://github.com/GeomScale/gsoc2020/wiki/High-dimensional-sampling-with-applications-to-structural-biology#tests) for this project were approached.  

Click on each task to see the relevant answers.

## [Easy task](test_easy.html): 
Compile and run VolEsti. Use the R extension to visualize sampling in a polytope.

## [Medium task](medium_again.html): 
Import the [e.coli dataset](http://bigg.ucsd.edu/models/e_coli_core) from bigg and create a matrix in R

## [Hard task](): 
Support lower dimensional polytopes in volesti and use existing methods to sample from them
