# Import the e.coli dataset from bigg and create a matrix in R

### Here are the libraries needed

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r libraries, include=TRUE}
library(jsonlite)
library(dplyr)
library(R.matlab)
library(volesti)
```

## First, we try the .json format

### We first get the data

```{r get_the_data}
data_url = "http://bigg.ucsd.edu/static/models/e_coli_core.json"
destination_file = "/home/haris/Desktop/gsoc2020/gsoc2020/e_coli_core.json"
download.file(data_url, destination_file)
```

### Then we parse them
We need to parse the .json file we got, to get a matrix with the reactions and the metabolites that participate in them.

```{r parse_them_to_get_a_matrix, echo=TRUE}
data = jsonlite::fromJSON( destination_file )

reactions = data$reactions

new_data = data["reactions"]


final_reactions = new_data$reactions$metabolites
reactions_names = reactions$id
table = cbind(reactions_names,final_reactions)

table_as_matrix = as.matrix(table)

head(table_as_matrix, 4)
```

### Result 
Here you can see finally how a single reaction from the network we had, can be seen in the first line of our matrix. One molecule of f6p_c and one atp_c are cosnumed to produce one of adp_c, one of h_c and one of fdp_c.

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="One of the reactions of the metabolic network. You can see the metabolites that are consumed as well as those that are produced; the network (left) confirms what the matrix shows (right).", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hariszaf/gsoc2020/master/test_medium_files/figure-html/gsoc2020_reactions.png")
```


## Second, the .mat format
### Get the data.. again
```{r get_the_data_again}
data_url = "http://bigg.ucsd.edu/static/models/e_coli_core.mat"
destination_file = "/home/haris/Desktop/gsoc2020/gsoc2020/e_coli_core.mat"
download.file(data_url, destination_file)
```

### Read the data and parse them properly
```{r read_mat_file}
data_from_mat = readMat(destination_file)

s_matrix = data_from_mat[1]
s_matrix = s_matrix[[1]]
s_matrix = matrix(s_matrix,ncol = ncol(s_matrix), nrow = nrow(s_matrix))

head(s_matrix)
```


### and finally, keep some more info from the data as variables

```{r mat_variables}
reactions_from_mat = s_matrix[8]
metabolites_from_mat = s_matrix[1]
genes_from_mat = s_matrix[5]

```

### and what we have is this:

An enzyme from those that catalyze the reactions:
```{r show_1}
reactions_from_mat[[1]][[1]]
```
The metabolites that take part: 
```{r show_2}
metabolites_from_mat[[1]][[1]]
```
And the genes from which these molecules come from:
```{r show_3}
genes_from_mat[[1]][[1]]
```


## Discussion
It seems that the .mat format is easier to handle. However, as this project will be implemented to a great extent in Python, we need to handle the .json format as well. That is because .json format is commonly used when working with Python.
